# United States Air Pollution Analysis

This repository contains the comprehensive analysis of air pollution levels across the United States from 2000 to 2016, focusing on the impact of four major pollutants: carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The analysis was conducted using data from over 4,000 monitoring stations, courtesy of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and highlights the changes in air quality and their implications on human health and the environment.

## Project Overview

Our project, *United States Air Pollution Analysis*, aims to offer deep insights into the air quality trends across different states in the US by leveraging a rich dataset containing measurements of key pollutants. Through meticulous data preprocessing and exploratory analysis in R and Tableau, our team, *Meaningful Patterns*, has crafted a series of interactive visualizations to understand the fluctuation of air quality indices and develop strategies for pollution reduction.

## Dataset

The dataset encompasses hourly, daily, and annual average measurements of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone from 2000 to 2016. After thorough cleaning and preprocessing, including unit standardization and null value treatment, the dataset provided a solid foundation for our analysis.

## Visualizations and Findings

Our exploratory journey through the data culminated in various visualizations, such as:

- **Correlation Matrix** and **QQ Plots**: To understand the relationships between different pollutants.
- **Waffle Plot**: Showcasing the proportion of each pollutant in the atmosphere.
- **Violin and Box Plots**: Illustrating the distribution and concentration of pollutants.
- **Line Graphs**: Demonstrating the trends in Air Quality Index (AQI) over the years.
- **Choropleth and Hex Tile Cartogram Dashboards**: Highlighting the geographical distribution of pollutants and their impact on AQI across the states.
- **Heat Map**: Providing insights into the seasonal variation of AQI for each pollutant.

### Key Insights

- Carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide show a significant correlation.
- Ozone levels peak during the summer months, indicating a seasonal pattern in air quality degradation.
- The air quality, in terms of sulfur dioxide, has shown improvement from 2000 to 2016.
- States with major urban centers exhibit higher pollution levels, underlining the impact of industrial and vehicular emissions.
